# How long is your support on your phone?
Why I even ask? Do you know that the easiest way to hack your device is just to use already well-known exploits? Each update exposes backdoors to your phone!* It is so easy to hack that way that veeeery few tries to hack an updated system.

# So... How long is your support on your phone?
* cheap androids - not supported at all
* next level androids - 1-year
* premium Android phones - 2 years
* Google Android phones (and some Premium ones with security only patches) - 3 years
* iPhone - 3 years for all updates, additional 2 for security updates. But! after the few years the updates seems to slow down your phone...
* Chrome OS/Book - 5 years
* Windows 10 - unlimited?

Add remember the clocks ticks for the premier not from when you buy it!

# What to do with the unsupported device?
* Throw it away? Wasted resources...
* Use it for some DIY project? Who does it? Less than 1% of the population?
* Sell it to the poorer country? What will they do with it, then?

# What is my problem
I wanted to have a long living tablet. I have now SG Note 10 2014. A premium 5 years old not supported device... Now I regret the money. The screen is still gorgeous! It's much better than the basic iPad 2018 9.7!

I change only my phones every 1-3 years. Tablet... why to change it so often? I don't use it so much

I've checked the new Android tablets. They still got short support. Google seems to forget the Android for the tablets (no new Google tablet since many years)... in flavour to ... Chrome OS! It still runs Android apps and it is better designed for tablets and has 5 years of support!


# But what you may do with Chrome OS?
Everything popular... but I do Scala software development, no JDK... Chrome OS is for cloud apps. I need some unpopular local apps.

# Windows 10?
The time support is the longest possible! Lacks in apps but I could work on it... but it's still a Windows which needs more care to work like on Linux.

# A very good solution does not exist
For now, I'll stick with a laptop with a Linux on it... Waiting for a 16GB 4-core cheap alternative to Surface Pro (why? better reading proportions and mobile screen in pivot)
