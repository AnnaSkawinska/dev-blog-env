# How long is your support on your phone?
Why I even ask? Do you know that the easiest way to hack your device is just to use already well know exploits? Each update expose backdoors to your phone. It is so easy to hack that way that veeeery few tries to hack an updated system.

# So... How long is your support on your phone?
* cheap androids - not supported at all
* next level androids - 1 year
* premium Android phones - 2 years
* Google Android phones (and some Premium ones with security only patches) - 3 years
* iPhone - 3 years for all updates, additonal 2 for security updates. But! after the few years the updates seems to slow down your phone...
* Chrome OS/Book - 5 years
* Windows 10 - unlimited?

# What to do with unsupported device?
* Throw it away? Wasted resourses...
* Use it for some DYI project? Who does it? Less than 1% of population?
* Sell it to the poorer country? What they will do with it, then?

# What is my problem
I wanted to have a long living tablet. I have now SG Note 10 2014. A premium not supported anymore device. Now I regret the money. The screen is still goergous! It's much better than basic iPad 2008 9.7!

I change only my phones by 1-3 years. Tablet... why to change it so often? I don't use it so much

I checked new Android tablets. They still got short support. Google seems to forgotten the Android for the tablets... in flavor to ... Chrome OS! It still runs Android apps and it is better designed for tablets and has 5 years support!

# But what you may do with Chrome OS?
Everything popular... but I do Scala software development, no JDK... Chrome OS is for cloud apps. I need some un-popular loclal apps.

# Windows 10?
The time support is the longest possible! Lacks in apps but I could work on it... but it's still a Windows which needs more care to work like on Linux.

# Very good solution does not exist
For now I'll stick with a laptop with a Linux on it... Waiting for a 16GB 4-core cheap alternative to Surface Pro (why? better screen propotsions and mobile screen in pivot)
