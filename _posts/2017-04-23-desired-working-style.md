# Specific work requirement.

## Remote work at full time.
Like it is commonly known.

## Partial remote work.
1-3 weeks on site, rest remotly. For 1-3 weeks I work onsite as your other coworkers. Rest I work remotly.

## Full onsite work but with extreme elastic working times.
3 weeks of very intensive work on site and 1 week off. Up to 12h x 6 days a week. In 3 weeks I will reach equivalent of a full time job.

For three weeks I am close to your workplace. I meet and do everything needed. I come early and end late. If possible I work during the 6-th day. All of those overdue hours I accumulate to have "a paid like week off". I also need a brake during the day to remain creative for so lond work day (half an hour without any interaction would be the maximum).

## Mix of above

# My commitment
During the days off I obligate to be available in case my context would be needed. I will check the messages and to advice if needed. For the possibily of remote intervention I need to schedule it to have my full equipment close to me.
