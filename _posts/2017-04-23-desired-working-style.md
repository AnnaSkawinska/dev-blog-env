I got a lot of job offers that were sent as a massive broadcast. I would like to get only accurate offers that make sense to my profile. To help you with that please read those working styles: 

## I Partial remote work
1-3 weeks on-site, rest remotely. For 1-3 weeks I work onsite as your other employees/contractors. Rest I work remotely.

## II Intensive three weeks and one week off
3 weeks of very intensive work on-site and 1 week off. Up to 12h x 6 days a week. In 3 weeks I will reach an equivalent of a full-time job.

For three weeks I am close to your workplace. I do everything needed. I come early and end late. If possible I work during the 6-th day. All this overtime I accumulate to have "a paid like week off". I also need a break during the day to remain creative (no longer than 30 min. without any interaction).

- If there would not be enough over-hours I would accept unpaid days off (3 at maximum per month). 
- If it is easier to count then instead of paid days off I agree to a higher daily rate with one not paid week allowance per month.

## III Remote work at full-time
Like it is commonly known.

## Any mix of above styles

## My commitment:
- During the days off I obligate to be available in case my context would be needed. I will check the messages and to advice if needed.
- For the possibility of remote intervention, I need to schedule it to have my full equipment close to me.
- Once a year I can do a long sprint without any weeks off (12h x 6 days max for 2 months).
